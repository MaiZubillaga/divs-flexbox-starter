                <p>I was born 31 July 1980, the only child of James and Lily Potter (n√©e Evans), both members of the original Order of the Phoenix. I married Ginny Weasley, with whom I have three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna.</p>

                <p>I learned that I was a wizard on my eleventh birthday. I began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. While at school I became best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. I later became the youngest Quidditch Seeker in over a century and eventually the captain of my house's team, winning two Quidditch Cups.</p>

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-item">
                <p>After the war, I became an Auror and helped reform and revolutionise the Ministry of Magic. In 2007 I was promoted to Head of the Auror Office (I was 26), and would occasionally deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts. I later went on to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement by the summer of 2020.</p>
